## FSP Validation analyses (Feb 2024)

**Goal:** Conduct FastScreen PLUS validation analysis according to validation plan.

**Note:** The folder "FSP_Exchange" is a copy of the shared folder on Share Point. It should by synchronized to contain the most recent data and analysis sheets as well as BRAHMS' R scripts.

**Usage::** A logged analysis run can be initiated via running the script `run_master.R`. It will internally source and call all relevant scripts and functions from folder `/R` and load all relevant data sets from folder `FSP_Exchange/data`.
